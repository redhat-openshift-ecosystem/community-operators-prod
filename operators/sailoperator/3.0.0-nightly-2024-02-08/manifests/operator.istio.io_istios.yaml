          Istio represents an Istio Service Mesh deployment consisting of one or more
          control plane instances (represented by one or more IstioRevision objects).
          To deploy an Istio Service Mesh, a user creates an Istio object with the
          desired Istio version and configuration. The Istio operator then creates
          an IstioRevision object, which in turn creates the underlying Deployment
          objects for istiod and other control plane components, similar to how a
          Deployment object in Kubernetes creates ReplicaSets that create the Pods.

                          If not set the system will use "*" as the default value which implies that

                          `All namespaces` is a reasonable default for implementations that don't
                          need to restrict access or visibility of services across namespace
                          boundaries. If that requirement is present it is generally good practice to
                          make the default `Current namespace` so that services are only visible
                          within their own namespaces by default. Operators can then expand the
                          visibility of services to other namespaces as needed. Use of `No Namespace`
                          is expected to be rare but can have utility for deployments where
                          dependency management needs to be precise even within the scope of a single
                          namespace.

                          A list of Kubernetes selectors that specify the set of namespaces that Istio considers when
                          computing configuration updates for sidecars. This can be used to reduce Istio's computational load
                          by limiting the number of entities (including services, pods, and endpoints) that are watched and processed.
                          If omitted, Istio will use the default behavior of processing all namespaces in the cluster.
                          Elements in the list are disjunctive (OR semantics), i.e. a namespace will be included if it matches any selector.
                          The following example selects any namespace that matches either below:
                          1. The namespace has both of these labels: `env: prod` and `region: us-east1`
                          2. The namespace has label `app` equal to `cassandra` or `spark`.

                          and redirect them towards Istio agent, which will then merge metrics of from the application with Istio metrics.
                          This relies on the annotations `prometheus.io/scrape`, `prometheus.io/port`, and
                          `prometheus.io/path` annotations.

                                    The format is `[<Namespace>/]<Hostname>`. The specification of `<Namespace>` is required only when it is insufficient
                                    to unambiguously resolve a service in the service registry. The `<Hostname>` is a fully qualified host name of a

                          network filters like TCP and Redis.
                          By default, Istio emits statistics with the pattern `inbound|<port>|<port-name>|<service-FQDN>`.
                          For example `inbound|7443|grpc-reviews|reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local`. This can be used to override that pattern.


                          A Pattern can be composed of various pre-defined variables. The following variables are supported.


                          - `%SERVICE%` - Will be substituted with name of the service.
                          - `%SERVICE_FQDN%` - Will be substituted with FQDN of the service.
                          - `%SERVICE_PORT%` - Will be substituted with port of the service.
                          - `%TARGET_PORT%`  - Will be substituted with the target port of the service.
                          - `%SERVICE_PORT_NAME%` - Will be substituted with port name of the service.


                          Following are some examples of supported patterns for reviews:


                          - `%SERVICE_FQDN%_%SERVICE_PORT%` will use reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local_7443 as the stats name.
                          - `%SERVICE%` will use reviews.prod as the stats name.

                              failoverPriority is an ordered list of labels used to sort endpoints to do priority based load balancing.
                              This is to support traffic failover across different groups of endpoints.
                              Two kinds of labels can be specified:


                                - Specify only label keys `[key1, key2, key3]`, istio would compare the label values of client with endpoints.
                                  Suppose there are total N label keys `[key1, key2, key3, ...keyN]` specified:


                                  1. Endpoints matching all N labels with the client proxy have priority P(0) i.e. the highest priority.
                                  2. Endpoints matching the first N-1 labels with the client proxy have priority P(1) i.e. second highest priority.
                                  3. By extension of this logic, endpoints matching only the first label with the client proxy has priority P(N-1) i.e. second lowest priority.
                                  4. All the other endpoints have priority P(N) i.e. lowest priority.


                                - Specify labels with key and value `[key1=value1, key2=value2, key3=value3]`, istio would compare the labels with endpoints.
                                  Suppose there are total N labels `[key1=value1, key2=value2, key3=value3, ...keyN=valueN]` specified:


                                  1. Endpoints matching all N labels have priority P(0) i.e. the highest priority.
                                  2. Endpoints matching the first N-1 labels have priority P(1) i.e. second highest priority.
                                  3. By extension of this logic, endpoints matching only the first label has priority P(N-1) i.e. second lowest priority.
                                  4. All the other endpoints have priority P(N) i.e. lowest priority.


                              Note: For a label to be considered for match, the previous labels must match, i.e. nth label would be considered matched only if first n-1 labels match.


                              It can be any label specified on both client and server workloads.
                              The following labels which have special semantic meaning are also supported:


                                - `topology.istio.io/network` is used to match the network metadata of an endpoint, which can be specified by pod/namespace label `topology.istio.io/network`, sidecar env `ISTIO_META_NETWORK` or MeshNetworks.
                                - `topology.istio.io/cluster` is used to match the clusterID of an endpoint, which can be specified by pod label `topology.istio.io/cluster` or pod env `ISTIO_META_CLUSTER_ID`.
                                - `topology.kubernetes.io/region` is used to match the region metadata of an endpoint, which maps to Kubernetes node label `topology.kubernetes.io/region` or the deprecated label `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region`.
                                - `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` is used to match the zone metadata of an endpoint, which maps to Kubernetes node label `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` or the deprecated label `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone`.
                                - `topology.istio.io/subzone` is used to match the subzone metadata of an endpoint, which maps to Istio node label `topology.istio.io/subzone`.


                              The below topology config indicates the following priority levels:


                              ```yaml
                              failoverPriority:
                              - "topology.istio.io/network"
                              - "topology.kubernetes.io/region"
                              - "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"
                              - "topology.istio.io/subzone"
                              ```


                              1. endpoints match same [network, region, zone, subzone] label with the client proxy have the highest priority.
                              2. endpoints have same [network, region, zone] label but different [subzone] label with the client proxy have the second highest priority.
                              3. endpoints have same [network, region] label but different [zone] label with the client proxy have the third highest priority.
                              4. endpoints have same [network] but different [region] labels with the client proxy have the fourth highest priority.
                              5. all the other endpoints have the same lowest priority.


                              Suppose a service associated endpoints reside in multi clusters, the below example represents:
                              1. endpoints in `clusterA` and has `version=v1` label have P(0) priority.
                              2. endpoints not in `clusterA` but has `version=v1` label have P(1) priority.
                              2. all the other endpoints have P(2) priority.


                              ```yaml
                              failoverPriority:
                              - "version=v1"
                              - "topology.istio.io/cluster=clusterA"
                              ```


                              Optional: only one of distribute, failover or failoverPriority can be set.
                              And it should be used together with `OutlierDetection` to detect unhealthy endpoints, otherwise has no effect.

                          Name to be used while emitting statistics for outbound clusters. The same pattern is used while computing stat prefix for
                          network filters like TCP and Redis.
                          By default, Istio emits statistics with the pattern `outbound|<port>|<subsetname>|<service-FQDN>`.
                          For example `outbound|8080|v2|reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local`. This can be used to override that pattern.


                          A Pattern can be composed of various pre-defined variables. The following variables are supported.


                          - `%SERVICE%` - Will be substituted with name of the service.
                          - `%SERVICE_FQDN%` - Will be substituted with FQDN of the service.
                          - `%SERVICE_PORT%` - Will be substituted with port of the service.
                          - `%SERVICE_PORT_NAME%` - Will be substituted with port name of the service.
                          - `%SUBSET_NAME%` - Will be substituted with subset.


                          Following are some examples of supported patterns for reviews:


                          - `%SERVICE_FQDN%_%SERVICE_PORT%` will use `reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local_7443` as the stats name.
                          - `%SERVICE%` will use reviews.prod as the stats name.

                          traffic from the application.  If your application uses one or
                          more external services that are not known apriori, setting the
                          policy to `ALLOW_ANY` will cause the sidecars to route any unknown
                          traffic originating from the application to its requested
                          destination. Users are strongly encouraged to use ServiceEntries
                          to explicitly declare any external dependencies, instead of using
                          `ALLOW_ANY`, so that traffic to these services can be
                          monitored. Can be overridden at a Sidecar level by setting the
                          `OutboundTrafficPolicy` in the [Sidecar
                          API](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/networking/sidecar/#OutboundTrafficPolicy).
                          Default mode is `ALLOW_ANY` which means outbound traffic to unknown destinations will be allowed.

                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                violate MaxSkew(1).
                                - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                to topologies that satisfy it.

                                MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                it will violate MaxSkew.
