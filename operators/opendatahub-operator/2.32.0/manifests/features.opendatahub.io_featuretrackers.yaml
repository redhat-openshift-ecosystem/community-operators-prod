          FeatureTracker represents a cluster-scoped resource in the Data Science Cluster,
          specifically designed for monitoring and managing objects created via the internal Features API.
          This resource serves a crucial role in cross-namespace resource management, acting as
          an owner reference for various resources. The primary purpose of the FeatureTracker
          is to enable efficient garbage collection by Kubernetes. This is essential for
          ensuring that resources are automatically cleaned up and reclaimed when they are
          no longer required.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
