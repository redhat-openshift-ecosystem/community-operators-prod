Conditions are an extension mechanism intended to be used when the details of an observation are not a priori known or would not apply to all instances of a given Kind. \n Conditions should be added to explicitly convey properties that users and components care about rather than requiring those properties to be inferred from other observations. Once defined, the meaning of a Condition can not be changed arbitrarily - it becomes part of the API, and has the same backwards- and forwards-compatibility concerns of any other part of the API."
