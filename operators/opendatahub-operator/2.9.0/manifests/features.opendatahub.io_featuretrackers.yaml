        description: FeatureTracker represents a cluster-scoped resource in the Data
          Science Cluster, specifically designed for monitoring and managing objects
          created via the internal Features API. This resource serves a crucial role
          in cross-namespace resource management, acting as an owner reference for
          various resources. The primary purpose of the FeatureTracker is to enable
          efficient garbage collection by Kubernetes. This is essential for ensuring
          that resources are automatically cleaned up and reclaimed when they are
          no longer required.
