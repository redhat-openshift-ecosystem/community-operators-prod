                            Mount Path Cautions:
                            Exercise caution when setting mount paths for secrets. Avoid mounting secrets to critical system paths
                            that may interfere with Kepler's operation or container security:
                            - /etc/kepler - Reserved for Kepler configuration files
                            - /sys, /proc, /dev - System directories that should remain read-only
                            - /usr, /bin, /sbin, /lib - System binaries and libraries
                            - / - Root filesystem

                            Best practices:
                            - Use subdirectories like /etc/kepler/secrets/ or /opt/secrets/
                            - Ensure mount paths don't conflict with existing volume mounts
                            - Test mount paths in development environments before production deployment
                            - Monitor Kepler pod logs for mount-related errors
