                  Since it is possible to have multiple OSD IDs associated to a node (see oc explain storagecluster.spec.storageDeviceSets.replica),
                  waiting for a new OSD linked to a node is not enough, thus we have to keep track of existing and newly created OSD IDs when
                  determining if a new OSD has been created to replace the failing one in a node.
